### SUMMARY/ABSTRACT

This dataset was developed as part of a study that assessed data reuse. Through bibliometric analysis, corresponding authors of highly cited papers published in 2015 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in nine STEM disciplines were identified and then surveyed to determine if data were generated for their article and their knowledge of reuse by other researchers. Second, the corresponding authors who cited those 2015 articles were identified and surveyed to ascertain whether they reused data from the original article and how that data was obtained. The project goal was to better understand data reuse in practice and to explore if research data from an initial publication was reused in subsequent publications.
