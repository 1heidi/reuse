"CHEM","No","our data are [redacted]. The [redacted] would not change upon use of our data by others, so there is no need to reuse the underlying data"
"CHEM","No","Readers generally trust that the data was analyzed properly and almost universally wont go to the bother to re-analyze others data unless there is blaring discrepancies."
"CHEM","No","The data was used to draw conclusions and for others to re-use it wasn't necessary, I think."
"COMP","No","The IRB only allows data to be shared with the research team at the team. Further sharing of the data might violate the agreement with the users who participated in the study."
"ENGI","No","Other researchers read and used our underlying data from the relevant publications we used to write the review paper under consideration. Of course, all these data have always been available upon request."
"ENGI","No","The key data is in the paper."
"ENGI","No","Specific material results for a specific location and mix design. Others would like for similar trends with their materials but unlikely to use my data."
"ENGI","No","The type of data is so common and accepted, there was no need for anyone to use the data. To View the data was enough."
"MEDI","No","This is a review paper and raw data are not available"
"PHYS","No","You didn't give the most likely option -- that other people HAVE used it, without me knowing it."
"CHEM","No","This paper established a ""first"" in this field and often it serves to give the discoverers the freedom to develop the work as their own."
